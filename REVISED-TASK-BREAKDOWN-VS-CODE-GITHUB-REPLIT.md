# Lisa's AI Meal Planner MVP - Task Breakdown
# VS Code → GitHub → Replit Workflow

**Version:** 2.0
**Date:** October 19, 2025
**Workflow:** Build in VS Code (Claude Code) → Commit to GitHub → Pull to Replit → Test

---

## WORKFLOW OVERVIEW

This task breakdown is designed for the following development workflow:

1. **VS Code Development**: Use Claude Code (or Copilot) to write code locally
2. **GitHub Version Control**: Commit code after each task/group of tasks
3. **Replit Testing**: Pull latest code from GitHub to Replit and test on server
4. **Iterate**: Fix issues, commit, pull, test again

**Important Notes:**
- We will NOT run a dev environment locally on your machine
- All runtime testing will be done on the Replit server
- Code will be assembled in VS Code, then pushed to GitHub, then pulled to Replit for testing
- After each commit, you'll see a prompt to pull and test in Replit

---

1. System Prompt (constant):
   - Use exact text from PRD:
     "You are an expert meal planning assistant. Generate exactly 7 unique dinner meal suggestions for one week based on the provided user preferences. Return your response as valid JSON only."

2. buildUserPrompt(userPreferences) function:
   - Takes userPreferences object
   - Constructs user prompt string with all preferences
   - Format dietary restrictions as comma-separated list
   - Format cuisine preferences as comma-separated list
   - Include family size
   - Include cooking time preference
   - Conditionally include disliked ingredients (only if provided)
   - Conditionally include additional notes (only if provided)
   - Template:
     "Generate a weekly meal plan for {familySize} people with the following preferences:
     - Dietary restrictions: {restrictions}
     - Preferred cooking time: {cookingTime}
     - Cuisine preferences: {cuisines}
     - Disliked ingredients: {dislikes} [only if provided]
     - Additional notes: {notes} [only if provided]"

3. Document Expected JSON Structure:

           "cuisine": "string"
         }
       ]
     }

4. Helper Functions:
   - formatArray(arr) to convert array to readable comma-separated string
   - validatePreferences(prefs) to check all required fields exist

Update generateMealPlan() to use buildUserPrompt() (still stub, actual API call in next task).
Include console logs for debugging prompts.
```

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] System prompt defined per PRD
- [ ] buildUserPrompt() function creates formatted prompt
- [ ] Conditional sections only included when data provided

   - Build user prompt using buildUserPrompt()
   - Make API call to OpenAI Chat Completion endpoint
   - Use configuration: MODEL, TEMPERATURE, MAX_TOKENS
   - Structure: system message + user message
   - Implement exponential backoff retry logic (MAX_RETRIES times):
     * 1st retry: 1 second delay
     * 2nd retry: 2 seconds delay
     * 3rd retry: 4 seconds delay
   - Parse JSON response from AI (response may be wrapped in markdown code blocks)
   - Validate response using validateMealPlan()
   - Return validated meal plan object

2. validateMealPlan(mealPlan) function:
   - Check that response has 'meals' array
   - Verify exactly 7 meals
   - For each meal, validate required fields:
     * day (string, not empty)
     * title (string, not empty)
     * description (string, not empty)
     * cookingTime (string, not empty)
     * cuisine (string, not empty)
   - Throw descriptive error if validation fails
   - Return validated meal plan

3. retryWithBackoff(fn, retries) helper:
   - Generic retry function with exponential backoff
   - Takes async function and number of retries
   - Implements delay between retries
   - Re-throws error after all retries exhausted

4. Error Handling:
   - Catch OpenAI API errors (auth, rate limit, etc.)
   - Catch JSON parsing errors
   - Catch validation errors
   - Log all errors with context
   - Throw user-friendly error messages:
     * "Unable to generate meal plan. Please check your API key."
     * "The AI service is temporarily unavailable. Please try again."
     * "Invalid meal plan received. Please try again."

5. Logging:
   - Log each API attempt
   - Log retry attempts
   - Log successful responses
   - Log validation results
   - Use different log levels (info, warn, error)

Include comprehensive comments and error messages.
```

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Full OpenAI API integration implemented
- [ ] Retry logic with exponential backoff works
- [ ] Response parsing handles various formats
- [ ] Validation ensures complete, correct meal plans

```

**📥 PULL TO REPLIT & TEST:**
```
1. In Replit Shell: git pull origin main
2. Verify OPENAI_API_KEY is set in Replit Secrets (must be valid key)
3. Test the service in Node REPL:
   - Run: node
   - const { generateMealPlan } = require('./services/openai.service.js');
   - Create test preferences:
     const testPrefs = {
       familySize: 2,
       dietaryRestrictions: ['Vegetarian'],
       cookingTime: '30 minutes',
       cuisinePreferences: ['Italian', 'Mediterranean'],
       dislikedIngredients: '',
       additionalNotes: ''
     };
   - Call: generateMealPlan(testPrefs).then(console.log).catch(console.error);
   - Expected: Should return meal plan object with 7 meals
   - Verify each meal has all required fields
   - Check that meals respect dietary restrictions and preferences
4. Test error handling:
   - Try with invalid API key (temporarily change in Secrets)
   - Should see user-friendly error message
   - Restore correct API key
5. Exit Node REPL: .exit
6. Check Replit console logs for detailed logging

Note: This test requires OpenAI API credits. If you see rate limit errors, wait a minute and try again.

       - Validation errors → 400 status
       - OpenAI API errors → 503 status (service unavailable)
       - Other errors → 500 status (internal server error)
     * Response format:
       {
         "success": false,
